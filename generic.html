								<p>A very enthralling run and my very first experience to run at night. I would like to thank RAID ESSEC for organizing such a great event. All of us had to put a headlight for navigation and were also provided refreshments at the end.</p>
								<p>The route had stairs, slopes and forest trails which made the night run more interesting and challenging at the same time. The volunteers constantly guided us in the correct directions in the pitch dark forests which and I am really thankful to their contribution as well.</p>

									<h1>Clean Ganga Run (DELHI)<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Ran 10k in 1hr with Rotaract Delhi Club members for Clean Ganga River Campaign. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ganga.png"  alt="" /></div>
								<p>Namami Gange event was organized by the National Comission for Clean Ganga in Delhi. I saw people come together in this run to get a closer connection towards the cause of 'Clean Ganga River'.</p>
								<p>For those who are unaware of the importance of the Ganga river in India , here is a short summary -
								
								The Ganges River is considered sacred in Hinduism and is worshipped as the goddess Ganga. It plays a central role in the lives of millions of people, serving as a source of water for drinking, agriculture, and other purposes. The Ganges is not only a physical river but also a spiritual and cultural icon. It has been referenced in various mythological and religious texts and is associated with rituals, festivals, and ceremonies. Many Hindu pilgrims visit the river to perform religious rituals, including taking a holy dip to cleanse themselves of sins.

								However, the Ganges also faces environmental challenges such as pollution and water quality degradation due to industrial waste, sewage, and other factors.</p>
